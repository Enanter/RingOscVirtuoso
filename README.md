1Ghz Ring Oscillator with CMOS inverters.

# Introduction
In this project, the goal is designing a 1Ghz ring oscillator with CMOS inverters using the IBM 0.18um library on Cadence Virtuoso. 
To create a ring oscillator, odd numbers of stages of inverters are going to be used to create target frequency. Inverters' propagation delay is going to generate different output frequencies.
The relationship between frequency and propagation delay follows the formula:
Frequency = 2* Propagation delay*Number of inverters
# Methodology 
To configure propagation delay, understanding MOSFET dependencies is the key.

The delay can be changed with different value of Vdd and (W/L)n on NMOS. PMOS has similar relationship with Vdd and (W/L)p.

Figure 8. 3 stage inverter CMOS ring oscillator that has Wp is 10 micrometers (width per finger is 5 micrometers with 2 fingers) and Wn is 2 micrometers (width per finger is 1 micrometer with 2 fingers). Supply voltage is 0.8 volt.

# Conclusion
3 stage inverter has been used to reduce area. However, the ratio of (W/L)p / (W/L)n is 5, which is not optimal (the optimal ratio is 3.8). This may result it consumes higher energy than a 5 stages inverter design.
The output frequency is 1.019GhZ. It is within 2% error.
